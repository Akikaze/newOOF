In order to add a new object, you just need to follow several rules in order
to facilitate the integration of this new object in the current architecture

1 - the new object needs to inherit from OOF_OBJ< newObject >
2 - you need to implement a specialization of CommandParser::parse
3 - you need to implement a specialization of ObjectStorage::load and save
4 - you need to add a case for newObject extension in ProjectStorage::find_ObjectStorage
